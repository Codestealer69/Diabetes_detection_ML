## Diabetes Prediction Model
This repository contains code for a diabetes prediction model built using Python and machine learning techniques. The model aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various medical features.

The model utilizes the following steps:

1. Data Loading: The dataset, stored in a CSV file named diabetes.csv, is loaded using Pandas.
2. Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset is performed, including displaying the top 5 rows, checking shape and null values, and obtaining overall statistics.
3. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by separating the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (outcome). Standardization is applied to scale the features.
4. Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the training data.
5. Model Evaluation: The accuracy score of the trained model on the training data is calculated.
6. Prediction: A predictive system is implemented to predict diabetes status based on input data.

## How it Works
The model utilizes linear regression to predict laptop prices. It preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values and creating dummy variables for categorical features. StandardScaler is used to scale the features and target variable. The model is then trained on the scaled data.

## Usage
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset containing laptop information is loaded and preprocessed. Missing values are handled, and dummy variables are created for categorical features.

2. Model Training: The features and target variable are scaled using StandardScaler. Linear regression is then applied to train the model.

3. Prediction: The trained model's prediction score is calculated, indicating its accuracy in predicting laptop prices.
## Installation
To import the libraries-
- import pandas as pd
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import numpy as np
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
- from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
- from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
- from sklearn import svm
- from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


Installation method for the libraies are:


```bash 
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```
- Or you can just git clone the code but please change the path files according to your local machine
```git clone https://github.com/Sayan-Maity-Code/Diabetes_detection_ML/blob/main/Diabetes_Project(ML).py```


- Install with npm

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/Sayan-Maity-Code/Diabetes_detection_ML/blob/main/Diabetes_Project(ML).py
```

## File Setup

1. Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and named `diabetes.csv`.
2. Running the Code: Execute the Python script to load, preprocess, train, and predict using the diabetes prediction model.
